# Summary

This is the summary about what I learn from the project

Because I have participated in developing since my first year of university in QSC Tech(求是潮技术研发中心), I am not so unfamiliar with the B/S design. So the organization of project is not a hard problem for me. The mainly part is how to build.

In this project, I use the classical python frame `flask` with some its extensions. Different from `Django`, flask is really a light frame. It can easily be built and use, and extensions cover all needs and can be easily added, which make me build a **Resstful API** easily. About the backend, the hardest part is how to keep the global *extension class* interact with the frame *app class*. This costs a lot of my time. Also, some extensions's usage like `swagger` also costs some time to understand.

The frontend use `vue-element-template` as the base. It is pity that this is a `vue2` frame and I just figure out the `vue2` instead of newer `vue3` (I latter find its `vue3` version while I have began writing). This *template* makes me know how to **organize a frontend** project and how to **use some package of vue**. For me who only use little frontend and mostly use `Flutter`, this is a great try and learn a lot.

For the mqtt part, by writing the subscriber and publisher, I figure out the relations between server, publisher and subscriber. Also, this makes me know how **Internet of Things** communicates with each other. I am interested in some IoT things such like Raperberry Pi and STM series, so this may be of some help in my latter use of IoT things.

Generally speaking, though I have some knowledge of BS design, these knowledge is all just theory. By a personal practive, I **translate these knowledge into implement** and understand them more. What's more, the sense of achievement from this project is incomparable. Thanks this course for such a chance.
